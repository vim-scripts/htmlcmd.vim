This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=14

This script handles a number of mundane tasks in HTML / XML.  It allows you to create a default HTML header (Alt+0),  to define headings <h1> .. <h6> (Alt+1.. Alt+6), to toggle bold, italic, underline, paragraphs & kbd commands.  It gives shortcuts for ordered/unordered lists and row definitions.  

The script has commands to insert horizontal rules, line-breaks, and a number of  special symbols (just email me to add your favourite).  

It has imap mappings that give you ampersands (&&), smart-quotes (single - &' and double &"), <, > symbols,   and more.  It allow you to insert these and text descriptors or as numbers (for strict XML)

You can close the next open tag (alt-;) or close all open tags at that point (alt->).  
Not you may need to remap these for other platforms.


If you have defined 'htmlcmd_AUTOCLOSE' then there is some reasonably intrusive code that will close open tags: 
try typing this
<p>Testing<b>bold</p>

This should automatically close the <b>

You can also generate a quick Table Of Contents for your document based on <H1>..<H6> headings.  There is a menu item to insert it.. and any options you give 
are remembered for when you re-generate the TOC. 

GenerateTOC( [<headingtypes>| * ]) 
:GenTOC [<headingtypes>| * ]

The optional argument is a string of types for each indent level. Eg. " 1ai." would mean level 1 is default (bullet), level 2 is a numbered list, level 3 has letters and level three has roman numerals. 
It uses references where it can find them, and generates new ones where it can't.
The arguments supplied are remembered so the TOC can be regenerated without resuplying them.
If * is supplied as an argument, the script prompts for arguments - showing what the current values are.

When used with buffermenu.vim - Menus (for TOC generation) are local to the buffer.
